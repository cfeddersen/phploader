phploader README

The YUI PHP Loader Utility is a server-side utility that allows you to 
load specific YUI components and their dependencies into your page via PHP.
YUI PHP Loader can operate as a holistic solution by loading all of your 
necessary YUI components, or it can be used to add one or more components 
to a page on which some YUI content already exists.

phploader requires a webserver with support for PHP 4.3.0+ or PHP 5+.
